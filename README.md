## Features 

### Select Module 
To import nodes from an existing module use the drop down bar. 
![Drop Down Image](dropdown.png)
This will pull all the nodes relating to this module that we have stored in our database. Note that changes you save will not persist here, and need to be sent to IT before they are updated in the system. 

### Save 
Selecting the save button will save the current state of your nodes and edges. Changes are not autosaved. Clicking this button is essential to save your progress.

Two files will be automatically saved to your Downloads. They will have the following naming convention:  

moduleCode_NODES[DATE].csv for the nodes file
or  
moduleCode_EDGES[DATE].csv for the edges file

The node file is a CSV file of each node and information pertaining to that node, such as it's title, code and optional/core status. 
The edges file contains a list of each node to node connection.

These files can be re-uploaded into module mate at a later stage (see Upload below) for further edits and review. These files can be sent to IT when they have been approved for addition into the database.
